When a material undergoes a change in its
composition it is called a chemical change
Let us do-9: Burning of Camphor
Have you ever seen “harathi” ?
Have you ever thought of the material used
in harathi?
It is “Camphor”, we burn it to get flame
(harathi). Observe what happens when you
burn Camphor?  Initially it changes into
liquid and then burns.  It is also considered
to be  a chemical change.
Take a small quantity of  Camphor in a dish
and place it in the open air. Observe it after
some time. What happens? Its quantity
reduces and you sense the smell of it. It
happens because camphor evaporates. Since

it has strong smell, it is used to keep  insects
and flies away.  It is also used in medicines.
From the  activities  discussed above  we
conclude that, in a chemical change, material
undergoes a change in its composition and a
new substance is formed.

What we have learnt?
• Air is everywhere.
• The moving air is called wind.
• Air around us exerts pressure.
• Air expands on heating and contracts on
cooling.
• Warm air rises up whereas comparatively
cooler air tends to sink towards the
earth’s surface.
• As warm air rises air pressure at the
place is reduced and the cooler air moves
into that place.
• Uneven heating on the earth causes wind
movements.
• Cyclones may be caused due to wind
traveling at high speed due to difference
in air pressure.
• It has become easier to study cyclones
with the help of  advanced technology
like satellites and radars.

air rises upward from near the surface. The
warm air rises causing an area of  lower air
pressure below. Air from surrounding areas
of high air pressure pushes into the low
pressure area. Then this “new” air becomes
warm and rises too.  As the warm air continues
to rise, the surrounding air swirls-in to take
its place and the water from the sea surface
also comes up with the air as you have seen in
activity 10. As the warmed moist air rises and
cools off, the water in the air forms clouds.
The whole system of clouds and winds spins
and grows, fed by the ocean’s heat and water
evaporating from the surface. See the figure

DESTRUCTION BY CYCLONES:

effects of cyclones include heavy rain and,
strong wind. The destruction of  a cyclone
depends mainly on its intensity, its size and its

• Can you say what happens to water?
• What do you observe?
• Why is the water spray coming out from

When you blow over the straw the water comes
out due to low pressure which forms inside
the straw. So the water from the glass reaches
up in the straw due to high pressure.
We see that the increased wind speed is
accompanied by a reduced air pressure.

The direction of the wind flow gets usually
reversed in the months from December to
early March. The wind flows from the land to
ocean as the sea cools more slowly..
The winds from the oceans carry water and
bring rains. Farmers in our country depend
mainly on rains for their harvests. We can also
generate energy from high speed wind. Thus
we can see the usefulness of winds in our life.

Activity - 3 :  Drawing a circuit diagram
In the previous class you have learnt about
some simple circuits. Let us
learn a little more about
them by performing a few
experiments.
Look at figure 6. A bulb,
battery and switch are
connected as shown. Can we
make this drawing simpler

What we have learnt?
• Air is everywhere.
• The moving air is called wind.
• Air around us exerts pressure.
• Air expands on heating and contracts on
cooling.
• Warm air rises up whereas comparatively
cooler air tends to sink towards the
earth’s surface.
• As warm air rises air pressure at the
place is reduced and the cooler air moves
into that place.
• Uneven heating on the earth causes wind
movements.
• Cyclones may be caused due to wind
traveling at high speed due to difference
in air pressure.
• It has become easier to study cyclones
with the help of  advanced technology
like satellites and radars.

There should be a source, which is one or
more electric cells(battery).  The switch can
be placed anywhere in the circuit.  If the switch
is in the ON position, the circuit is complete
from the positive terminal of  the battery to
its negative terminal. The circuit is then said
to be closed and the current flows throughout
the circuit constantly.  The wires should not
have any discontinuity (gaps).  When the switch
is in the OFF position, the circuit is
incomplete. It is said to be open.  No current
flows through any part of the circuit.
Observe the sequence in which the cell, bulb
and switch are connected in the circuit.
The sequence of components is as follows:

     Text: Fusion of units of male and female parts to
form a structure called as zygote is called
Fertilization.
After fertilization seed develops from the
ovule and the ovary usually develops into a
fruit. The entire process of  fertilization and
formation of  zygote is known as Sexual
reproduction. For the formation of  a seed
sexual reproduction is essential. The seed thus
formed are dispersed to different places by
agents like air, water, birds and animals and
by human beings as well. These seeds grow
into new plants under favourable conditions.
Production of baby plants or offsprings from the zygote is called sexual reproduction.
