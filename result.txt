Let us do-9: Burning of Camphor
Have you ever seen “harathi” ?
Have you ever thought of the material used
in harathi?
It is “Camphor”, we burn it to get flame
(harathi). Observe what happens when you
burn Camphor?  Initially it changes into
liquid and then burns.  It is also considered
to be  a chemical change.
Take a small quantity of  Camphor in a dish
and place it in the open air. Observe it after
some time. What happens? Its quantity
reduces and you sense the smell of it. It
happens because camphor evaporates. Since

it has strong smell, it is used to keep  insects
and flies away.  It is also used in medicines.
From the  activities  discussed above  we
conclude that, in a chemical change, material
undergoes a change in its composition and a
new substance is formed.

What we have learnt?
• Air is everywhere.
• The moving air is called wind.
• Air around us exerts pressure.
• Air expands on heating and contracts on
cooling.
• Warm air rises up whereas comparatively
cooler air tends to sink towards the
earth’s surface.
• As warm air rises air pressure at the
place is reduced and the cooler air moves
into that place.
• Uneven heating on the earth causes wind
movements.
• Cyclones may be caused due to wind
traveling at high speed due to difference
in air pressure.
• It has become easier to study cyclones
with the help of  advanced technology
like satellites and radars.

air rises upward from near the surface. The
warm air rises causing an area of  lower air
pressure below. Air from surrounding areas
of high air pressure pushes into the low
pressure area. Then this “new” air becomes
warm and rises too.  As the warm air continues
to rise, the surrounding air swirls-in to take
its place and the water from the sea surface
also comes up with the air as you have seen in
activity 10. As the warmed moist air rises and
cools off, the water in the air forms clouds.
The whole system of clouds and winds spins
and grows, fed by the ocean’s heat and water
evaporating from the surface. See the figure

DESTRUCTION BY CYCLONES:

• Can you say what happens to water?
• What do you observe?
• Why is the water spray coming out from

When you blow over the straw the water comes
out due to low pressure which forms inside
the straw. So the water from the glass reaches
up in the straw due to high pressure.
We see that the increased wind speed is
accompanied by a reduced air pressure.

The direction of the wind flow gets usually
reversed in the months from December to
early March. The wind flows from the land to
ocean as the sea cools more slowly..
The winds from the oceans carry water and
bring rains. Farmers in our country depend
mainly on rains for their harvests. We can also
generate energy from high speed wind. Thus
we can see the usefulness of winds in our life.

What we have learnt?
• Air is everywhere.
• The moving air is called wind.
• Air around us exerts pressure.
• Air expands on heating and contracts on
cooling.
• Warm air rises up whereas comparatively
cooler air tends to sink towards the
earth’s surface.
• As warm air rises air pressure at the
place is reduced and the cooler air moves
into that place.
• Uneven heating on the earth causes wind
movements.
• Cyclones may be caused due to wind
traveling at high speed due to difference
in air pressure.
• It has become easier to study cyclones
with the help of  advanced technology
like satellites and radars.

There should be a source, which is one or
more electric cells(battery).  The switch can
be placed anywhere in the circuit.  If the switch
is in the ON position, the circuit is complete
from the positive terminal of  the battery to
its negative terminal. The circuit is then said
to be closed and the current flows throughout
the circuit constantly.  The wires should not
have any discontinuity (gaps).  When the switch
is in the OFF position, the circuit is
incomplete. It is said to be open.  No current
flows through any part of the circuit.
Observe the sequence in which the cell, bulb
and switch are connected in the circuit.
The sequence of components is as follows:

     Text: Fusion of units of male and female parts to
form a structure called as zygote is called
Fertilization.
After fertilization seed develops from the
ovule and the ovary usually develops into a
fruit. The entire process of  fertilization and
formation of  zygote is known as Sexual
reproduction. For the formation of  a seed
sexual reproduction is essential. The seed thus
formed are dispersed to different places by
agents like air, water, birds and animals and
by human beings as well. These seeds grow
into new plants under favourable conditions.
Production of baby plants or offsprings from the zygote is called sexual reproduction.

Formation of Clouds and Rain
When there is rise in temperature, water
vapour rises and reaches high up in the sky,
and it gets cooled. This is because the
atmosphere gets cooler as we rise above
the surface of the earth. With the cooling,
water vapour is transformed into tiny water
droplets. These droplets gather around
minute dust or smoke particles in the air
and gradually increase in size. These small
drops of water gather to form the clouds.

the clothes dry. Similarly, if you keep some
water in a plate, it dries up in a couple of
days. Actually, water in the clothes or in
the plate becomes water vapour and mixes
with the air through a process called
‘evaporation’. So, even when water is not
boiling there is evaporation.
There are several water bodies on the
earth’s surface – oceans, rivers, lakes etc.
There is constant evaporation of water from
these water bodies. In fact, wherever there

When you blow over the straw the water comes
out due to low pressure which forms inside

up in the straw due to high pressure.
We see that the increased wind speed is
accompanied by a reduced air pressure.

Tropical cyclones are like giant engines that

air rises upward from near the surface. The
warm air rises causing an area of  lower air
pressure below. Air from surrounding areas
of high air pressure pushes into the low
pressure area. Then this “new” air becomes
warm and rises too.  As the warm air continues
to rise, the surrounding air swirls-in to take
its place and the water from the sea surface
also comes up with the air as you have seen in
activity 10. As the warmed moist air rises and
cools off, the water in the air forms clouds.
The whole system of clouds and winds spins
and grows, fed by the ocean’s heat and water
evaporating from the surface. See the figure

• Air is everywhere.
• The moving air is called wind.
• Air around us exerts pressure.
• Air expands on heating and contracts on
cooling.
• Warm air rises up whereas comparatively
cooler air tends to sink towards the
earth’s surface.
• As warm air rises air pressure at the
place is reduced and the cooler air moves
into that place.
• Uneven heating on the earth causes wind
movements.
• Cyclones may be caused due to wind
traveling at high speed due to difference
in air pressure.
• It has become easier to study cyclones
with the help of  advanced technology
like satellites and radars.

• Where does it go?
Observations from above activities indicate
that warm air rises up. Also, it is important to
remember that on heating the air expands and
occupies more space. When something
occupies more space, it becomes less dense
and lighter. The warm air  is therefore  less
dense and lighter than  cold air. Thus smoke
and hot air go up.
Similar to observations of  activities done so
far, numerous factors contribute to heat air.

fertilizers increases the production of  crops,
it changes the nature of the soil. Some

What we have learnt?
• Motion is a common experience in our
life.
• An object is said to be in motion if it
changes it’s position. And it is said to be
in rest if  it does not changes it’s position
with respect to time.
• There are three types of motion namely
translatory motion, rotatory motion and
oscillatory motion.
• We measure time by using diffrent
instruments like electronic clocks,
digital clocks, etc.
• Speedometer helps us  know the speed
of a vehicle.
• Units of speed in SI system is meters
per second. In another system it is kilo
meter per hour

moving in circular path around a fixed
point. The imaginary line passing through
this fixed point is called axis of rotation.
This type of motion is called Rotatory
Motion.
Rotatory motion means that, motion of all
particles of a moving body follow a  circular
path with respect to a fixed centre or axis
of rotation.

Take a table tennis ball, and keep it on the
surface of a table. Push the ball with your finger
and observe its motion.
Fig. 26
Is it in Rotatory motion or in
Translatory motion?
When you push the ball on the surface of a
table, it moves from one end  to the other end
and all the particles of the ball also move along
the direction of motion of the ball. Hence the
ball is in translatory motion. Similarly, each
particle of the ball moves in a circular path
about a particular line, when the ball rolls on
the surface. Therefore it is in rotatory motion.
Thus in the above example the ball possesses
both translatory and rotatory motion.

We observe many objects in motion in our daily life.  In some cases objects move slowly and in
other cases they move fast.  How do we know whether the motion is slow or fast?
Let us assume that you started to school on a bicycle and your friend started in a bus at the
same time from a place.
• Who reaches the school first? Why?
• Do you find any difference in the time taken by bicycle and bus to reach the school?

Speed of a car = 12.5 m/s
1 km/h = 5/18 m/s
1 m/s =18/5 km/s
Thus the speed of car is
12.5 x 18/5 km/h = 45 km/h
Hence, the bus moves faster than the car

     Text: speed of the car is not uniform.  To find
the speed of the car in the journey we
should calculate total distance travelled by
the car and the total time taken to cover
that distance.
Total distance travelled by the car = 60 km
Time taken = 40 min.
The distance must be either in meters or
kilometers and time in seconds or hours. We
express the speed either in m/s or in km/h.
In  this example distance is 60 km  and time is
40 min.
1 hour = 60 min

Solve the following problem
The speed of a bus is 72 km/h, whereas the
speed of a car is 12.5 m/s. Which vehicle
moves faster?
To compare two speeds.  They must be
expressed in the same units.  In the above
example, speed of a bus is expressed in km/
h and the speed of a car in m/s, to compare
these speeds, one of them must be

time in the table.  Some examples are given
in the table.
• Does the speed of the vehicle remain
the same throughout the journey?
• If not, what can you say about the speed
of the vehicle during the journey?
We experience in our everyday life that
most of the objects in motion do not have
the same speed throughout the journey.  To
express the speed of the object, we consider
its average speed.
How to calculate the average speed?
Average speed = Total distance travelled /
Total time taken to travel the distance
Thus we can define speed of an
object as the distance travelled by
it in a unit of time.

Units of speed
Depending on the need and context, speed
is measured in different units.
Unit of speed in S.I. system is meter per
second (m/s)
Another unit commonly used for speed is
kilometer per hour (Km/h)
1 Km / h = 5/18 m/s
Do you know how we got this?
1 km = 1000 m
1 h = 3600s
1 km / h = 1000 m / 3600s
= 5/18 m/s
If we travel 1km in 1 hour it means we
travelled 5 meters in 18 seconds.
Consider a car driven on a road. A person
seated beside the driver recorded the
distance travelled after every 10 minutes by
noting the distance reading in the
Odometer.  The distance travelled by the
car at different instances of time is as follow.
From the table, we notice that the car has
covered unequal distances in equal
intervals of time (10 min), which shows the
speed of the car is not uniform.  To find
the speed of the car in the journey we
should calculate total distance travelled by
the car and the total time taken to cover
that distance.
